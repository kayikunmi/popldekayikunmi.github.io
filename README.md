# popldekayikunmi.github.io
Popdle was created by kayikunmi, and inspired by the original Wordle game (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and Hannah Park's wordle clone (https://github.com/hannahcode/wordle).
It has the same rules as the original wordle game, but with a different set of answers.
All the answers have to do with pop culture facts, famous names, social media apps, movies, songs and tv shows.
It's a daily game, so remebr to check in everyday to play and share your results online.
